# color-clock
The  three numbers on the screen are refer to the three parts of a clock. (first is the hour, second is the minute, third is the second) It refreshed continously by the real date on your computer. The 2 * 3 numbers you see, are changing the hex code of the background-color. Hex code (code of color) also consists of 6 charecter, like our clock, so every change in our clock change the hex code of background-color.
(I set 3 big color change of the background-color in every 10, 20, 30 seconds, just because the color change will be easily visible.)
